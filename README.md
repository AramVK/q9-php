QuakeNet Services
==============

This is QuakeNet's Q bot + O and some other services, written in PHP.

I created this back in 2006, updated it in 2010 for the ircd update asuka -> snircd.

I decided to put this on github as someone might want to play with it or use it to see how to create IRC service bots.

It contains the following bots:

- Q (channel service)
- O (Oper, administration)
- G (Help)
- R (Request a channel service)
- V (Version tracking of clients)
- Google (joins on invite)

Install & run
--------------
Import the .sql file
Edit config.php

To run it:
php main.php
